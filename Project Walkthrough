# Project Walkthrough and errors:

•	Prefect requires graphviz to outputting graph which runs on python 3.6. 
	Environment had to be installed with python version 3.6
•	After cloning the git repository spend time trying to download nii files
	from bit torrent link via aria2c. Multiple failures. Then manually download the files. 
	Could not use pidycom as files were in nii so had to install nibabel.
•	Realised tags were private, tried to access them then informed you. Task removed.
•	Assumed project has to be run on server but should be accessible from anywhere. 
	Configured jupyter notebook via port forwarding to be accessed from local laptop. 
	The concept was new to me and I didn’t realise ports were not opened. 
	After trying various different experiments realised port is closed. Informed you but burnt a lot of 		time.
•	Server kept dying when I used jupyter notebook from local computer via web browser. 
	No prior experience in mobaxterm/ssh tunnelling so tried to set up config file to keep server alive.
	Later figured how to keep it alive via mobaxterm.
•	Getting the automation graph to include retries, failure handling ,upstreaming task, scheduling,
	passing code to terminal, trying terminal commands for the first time- consumed a bit of time.
•	Validating task flow to realise purging not implemented properly. Command lines to purge had 
	to be altered multiple times as any output apart from code 1 is considered as failure by prefect.
•	Lost an entire session as I thought I committed properly but something went wrong. Reason unknown.
•	Prefect server failed due to docker issue. Installed docker and docker compose. 
	When retrying task failed again as permission was denied.
	Fixed docker compose’s permission for non sudo user access. 
•	Server could not start as default port was set to 8080. Figured config for changing port. Once the UI
	was up could not connect to graphql API. Without graphql GUI was unable to config to our flow. Asked you
	to activate 4200 but still not able to solve issue. Spend more than a day reading forums and checking 
	various configs. Pinged on slack who help figure the issue. Turns out 4200 is most likely not open. 
	I didn’t recheck at first because you confirmed to open it. Later figured how to change config for graphql. 
	It connected to prefect server but page loading issue. Awaiting reply from the prefect community.
•	Testing of code with scheduler, what happens if folder structure is changed or delete or not existing. 
	Incorporated changes in code
•	Documentation of readme.md
•	Documentation of project report
Note: Minor deviations from instructions to showcase functionality. Eg- using jupyter notebook instead of
single python file. Creation of extra files in result.
